It serves as a space where I can introduce myself, showcase my favorite work, and as sort of a personal note-taking/journal. Let me begin with the introduction; perhaps I'll add some showcases later. When you land on the page, you might be surprised by its simple and minimalistic approach. Let me explain.

As most of the designers know, working on your portfolio can be a hell of a job! The ever-changing digital trends, never being satisfied, and often limited front-end skills. All this influenced my decision to opt for this minimalistic yet timeless design. (I might occasionally spice it up, but donâ€™t expect anything too fancy.)

## Audience
Those who know me are aware that I'm not the most outspoken or "show off" individual. I prefer to keep a low profile, which is why I primarily created this page for myself, with some consideration for other visitors, likely fellow designers, product people or cycling enthusiasts?

## Writing
Yes, I've added a blog. Here, I will attempt to write about various topics, mainly focused on design. Now, do not expect groundbreaking articles; rather, it's my perspective on random subjects within the field. As I will always add new content, I may change your mind about older posts.

      <title>Why I made this website</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/my-first-post/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It serves as a space where I can introduce myself, showcase my favorite work, and as sort of a personal note-taking/journal. Let me begin with the introduction; perhaps I&amp;rsquo;ll add some showcases later. When you land on the page, you might be surprised by its simple and minimalistic approach. Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As most of the designers know, working on your portfolio can be a hell of a job! The ever-changing digital trends, never being satisfied, and often limited front-end skills. All this influenced my decision to opt for this minimalistic yet timeless design. (I might occasionally spice it up, so donâ€™t expect anything too fancy.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;audience&#34;&gt;Audience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who know me are aware that I&amp;rsquo;m not the most outspoken or boastful individual. I prefer to keep a low profile, which is why I primarily created this page for myself, with some consideration for other visitors, likely fellow designers or product people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blog&#34;&gt;Blog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I&amp;rsquo;ve added a blog. Here, I will attempt to write about various topics, mainly focused on design. Now, do not expect groundbreaking articles; rather, it&amp;rsquo;s my perspective on random subjects within the field. As I will always add new content, I may change your mind about older posts, but hey, take it with a grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;
